Happy Birthday AMD, good on you turning 50!! I have already shared this story months ago with our very own AMD_Mickey, cause I wanted a AMD rep to know my pc life story and how AMD has treated me as a company.

My very first computer was a 15‚Äù laptop with a penom xii cpu and HD AMD gpu (I want to say 5650/5750), and for it being over 10 years ago that laptop was my saving grace.

Hello all! I‚Äôm SkoomaSteve and I‚Äôm one of the latest DCS addicts! I‚Äôve been known my entire life to geek out over anything aviation related! Finding DCS world was a dream come true for me.

Dear Faggots, I've thought about making a video on this for awhile but it wouldn't get shit for views so fuck that, my time is much better spent on watching YouTube and looking at you spergs lose money.
