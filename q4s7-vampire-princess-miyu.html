I just got my hands on two different print runs of volume 2 of Vampire Princess Miyu. This ebay listing (https://www.ebay.com/p/Vampire-Princess-Miyu-Vol-2-by-Toshihiro-Hirano-and-Narumi-Kakinouchi-2002-Paperback/2657462) has pictures of the two covers.

Vampire Princess Miyu Looking for a dark, moody anime that does not drag on forever? Give Vampire Princess Miyu (https://myanimelist.net/anime/1384/Kyuuketsuhime_Miyu) a try. The four episode OVA centers on Miyu, a vampire girl who hunts "Shinma", demon-like beings. In turn, Miyu is chased by Himiko Se, self-employed expert for the occult. In classic vampire storytelling tradition, the viewer follows the point of view of Himiko, yet Miyu (https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/max50. Miyu is an eternally youthful vampire princess. She is the Guardian, whose duty it is to return the Shinma - god demons that prey on humans - to the dark. Her only companion, and protector is Larva, a Western Shinma who is bound to serve. My mam is looking for a new manga to buy and read. I know that she liked Vampire Miyu in the 90s but i dont think she read much other manga. She read a few western comics like Ghost too so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I don't really read anything other than jojolion so I can't suggest anything. Just preferably stuff that has official printed English translations, as opposed to scanlations as she likes having physical copies of books. Thai copies would work too i guess but she'd kill me haha thanks in advanc. I could not find the folder icons for the following anime. Please help me!!! ~~Saint Seiya~~ (https://myanimelist.net/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya) Kyuuketsuhime Miyu (https://myanimelist.net/anime/690/Kyuuketsuhime_Miyu_TV) Kidou Senkan Nadesico (https://myanimelist.net/anime/218/Kidou_Senkan_Nadesico) Dragon Quest - Dai no Daibouken (https://myanimelist.net/anime/2229/Dragon_Quest__Dai_no_Daibouken) Black Magic M-66 (https://myanimelist.net/anime/1270/Black_Magic_M-66).

Part of a series of imported posts from the consilium games tumblr (https://consilium-games.tumblr.com/), feel free to respond as if it were any reddit post! I said I'd try to post more frequently, and though things have gotten fairly nuts on the home front, I can at least try. Next post, extenuating circumstances notwithstanding, I'll try to have some good material on an idea I wish I had more time to really play with, but for now, this. ## Varying Your Rules (And Not Burning Them Down). I am still pissed off about what happened yesterday when Michigan crapped the bed. So, a poor tortured Michigan fan like myself can only think about the past and wish the glory days would return. And what better way of doing so by doing another one of these articles where we talk about what happened in the Japanese Pop Culture/Gaming realm the last time Michigan won it all? Granted, it was a split title, as Nebraska won the Coaches Poll title due to certain circumstances (Tom Osborne retiring. You know what? Fuck it. Red Sox are winning this series anyway, so I might as well write this now before everything here blows up with "Congrats, Dodgers!" posts. 1988 - It was a year of many things. Bush Sr. was elected president. The Pistons got screwed over in the NBA Finals. Toyota and Nissan are about to reveal their new luxury car brands. But that year, the Dodgers won their most recent World Series title, as they upset a 104-win A's team in 5 games, thanks to Kirk Gibson's (former Tiger). Repost from r/UrinatingTree I am still mad about what happened Saturday when Michigan crapped the bed. So, a poor tortured Michigan fan like myself can only think about the past and wish the glory days would return. And what better way of doing so by doing another one of these articles where we talk about what happened in the Japanese Pop Culture/Gaming realm the last time Michigan won it all? As I'm a Michigan fan with interesting hobby tastes on the side. Granted, it was a split title Hello, I’m an old-timer anime fan who’s been out of the loop for a long time. I’m looking for some good horror anime, like the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA, Demon City Shinjuku, and, say, Corpse Party Troubled Souls. I’m not looking for gore, but I’m not bothered by it. I’m more interested in story however. Here my list A-Azumanga Daioh/A-channel/Alien Nine/Aki Sora B-Boku wa Tomadachi ga Sakunai C-Citrus/Candy Boy D-Dokuro-chan/Dagashi Kashi E-Eromanga Sensei F-Futari wa ecchi G-Gakkou no Kaidan/GOUCHIUSA H-higurashi no naku koro ni I-Ichigo Mashimaro J-JIGOKU shoujo/Jojo Bizarre adventures K-Kiss x sis/Kore wa zombiebdesuka/K-on/KONOHANA kitan/kodomo no Jikan L-Le Portrait de Petit Cosset/Lotte no Omocha M-Mermaid Forest/Mitsuboshi collors N-Narutaru O-OREIMO P-please Twins. I remember this anime, that I watched in a local tv in Italy before of 2010. The protagonist is a girl that transform and fight evil, and her friend/classmate transform in an "evil" magical girl (she is like possessed/hypnotized). I think the "evil" girl had dark hair, and I'm pretty sure the design of the anime was mature, and I think with darker color than usual (no green hair, or strange things, and the characters were teenager and looked like it, it wasn't a style like Madoka Magica). Hello there everyone, my name is Ariadne and I am a member of Colour Youth, a youth LGBT activist group located in Athens, Greece. I agreed with the group to prepare a presentation about anime/manga and homosexuality on late September or October. For that reason I am making a list of titles that I could use in said presentation. What I think will make this project unique is that I don't want to focus on yaoi/yuri, but on instances of homosexuality outside of those genres. So with the new year, I was looking over my old laserdisc collection, and it made me wonder what I was watching and buying 20 years ago for 1997. So checking MAL for 1997 (https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/1997/winter), this is what I can remember watching that was released that year. I'm sure there was more (I was buying alot of LD's that year), but this does not include older series that were released on LD in 1997 (a list for that would take a lot longer to look up). TV continuing. 
It's been about 12 months since I posted this list (now updated) so I'm posting it again :) This is a list of overlooked/underrated anime with a dub that have less than 5,000 ratings on MAL, some are over 5k because of the age. Twilight of the Cockroaches (https://myanimelist.net/anime/4210/Gokiburi-tachi_no_Tasogare) only 250 ratings, 1987. Project Blue Earth SOS ( only 662 ratings. 2006 series. Kurogane Commun. i have the curyosity if theres any anime figure collector that prefer Retro Stuff I also looking for Cream Lemon's and Vampire Princess Miyu,I wanna know if older figures </p>
